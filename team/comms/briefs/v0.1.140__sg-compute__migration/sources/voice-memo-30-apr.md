## The Naming Problem

The current naming is a patchwork of legacy decisions:

- The project is called "SP" (SGraph Playwright), which is wrong: Playwright is just one of many components now
- Each instance is called a "stack," which is wrong: a stack should be a combination of multiple instances, not one
- The overall product is sometimes called "ephemeral EC2," which is too narrow: it is bigger than EC2

Now is the right time to fix this. We are in the middle of a refactoring. The code, the CLI, the API, and the UI can all be renamed together.

## Proposed Taxonomy

### The Product: Ephemeral Compute

The overall platform is **Ephemeral Compute**. Not "ephemeral EC2" (too narrow, too AWS-specific). Not "ephemeral infrastructure" (too vague). Ephemeral Compute says what it is: compute that exists temporarily.

### The Instances: Nodes

Each running instance is a **Node**. Not "instance" (too AWS-specific), not "stack" (that is something else).

A node:
- Is a single EC2 instance (today) or any compute unit (tomorrow)
- Always has Docker, Podman, or Kubernetes installed
- Always has a FastAPI control plane running
- Always has sidecars available (MITM proxy, remote browser)
- Has an identity (node ID, type, creation time, status)
- Is ephemeral (auto-terminates after idle timeout)

"Active nodes" are nodes currently running. "Node history" is past nodes that have been terminated.

### The Containers: Pods

Inside each node, the running containers are **Pods**. This aligns with Kubernetes terminology (which we will eventually support) and is accurate even for Docker/Podman today: each "pod" is a container (or group of related containers including sidecars).

A pod:
- Runs inside a node
- Is a Docker/Podman container (or Kubernetes pod, eventually)
- Has a name, image, ports, status, logs
- Can be long-running (Playwright, Firefox, Elastic) or ephemeral (run-and-destroy)

### The Definitions: Specs (or Recipes)

The definition of what a node should look like is a **Spec**. This is the template: what AMI to use, what containers to start, what sidecars to attach, what configuration to apply.

A spec:
- Defines a node type (Firefox, Elastic, Playwright, SG/Send Vault, Ollama, etc.)
- Can be "baked" into an AMI for fast launch
- Is stored as a JSON file in the vault or in the code
- Is versioned (spec v1.2 produces a different node than spec v1.1)

Current specs (and growing):

| Spec | What It Produces | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Docker | Bare node with Docker runtime | Working |
| Podman | Bare node with Podman runtime | Working |
| Firefox + MITM | Firefox browser with MITM proxy sidecar | Working |
| Neko | Self-hosted browser via WebRTC | Working |
| OpenSearch | OpenSearch (legacy, slow start) | Working |
| Elastic + Kibana | Elastic Search + Kibana dashboards | Working |
| SG/Send Backend | Vault server (SG/Send API) | To be added |
| Ollama | Local LLM server | To be added |
| Linux Terminal | Bare Linux with shell access | To be added |

### The Combinations: Stacks

A **Stack** is a combination of multiple nodes deployed together. This is the correct use of "stack": not a single instance, but a coordinated group.

A stack:
- Defines 2+ nodes that should exist together
- Specifies networking between them (same VPC, security group)
- Is launched with one command/click
- Is destroyed as a unit

Reserve "stack" for this. Do not use it for single nodes.

## The Naming Map

| Old Term | New Term | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| SP (SGraph Playwright) | Ephemeral Compute | Product is bigger than Playwright |
| Stack (single instance) | Node | Stack means multi-instance combination |
| Instance | Node | Less AWS-specific |
| Container | Pod | Aligns with Kubernetes, future-proof |
| Definition / config | Spec | Clear, concise, version-controllable |
| Multiple instances together | Stack | Correct use of "stack" |

## How This Maps to Code

### CLI

```bash
# Old
sg-sp stack start --type firefox
sg-sp stack list
sg-sp stack stop i-abc123

# New
sg-compute node start --spec firefox
sg-compute node list
sg-compute node stop node-abc123
sg-compute pod list --node node-abc123
sg-compute pod start --node node-abc123 --image nginx
sg-compute pod logs --node node-abc123 --pod playwright-1
sg-compute stack start --spec full-observability
```

### API

```
# Nodes
POST   /api/nodes              { spec: "firefox", size: "t3.small" }
GET    /api/nodes
GET    /api/nodes/{id}
DELETE /api/nodes/{id}

# Pods (per node)
GET    /api/nodes/{id}/pods
POST   /api/nodes/{id}/pods    { image: "nginx", ports: {"80": 80} }
GET    /api/nodes/{id}/pods/{name}
GET    /api/nodes/{id}/pods/{name}/logs
DELETE /api/nodes/{id}/pods/{name}

# Specs
GET    /api/specs              (list available specs)
GET    /api/specs/{name}       (spec definition)

# Stacks
POST   /api/stacks             { spec: "full-observability" }
GET    /api/stacks
DELETE /api/stacks/{id}
```

### Frontend

The UI reflects the taxonomy:

```
Left Nav:
    Nodes        (create, list active, history)
    Specs        (browse available specs, manage AMIs)
    Stacks       (create from multi-node specs)
    Settings     (feature toggles, defaults)
```

### Folder Structure

```
sg-compute/
    |
    +--> core/
    |       +--> node_manager.py
    |       +--> pod_manager.py
    |       +--> stack_manager.py
    |       +--> runtime/
    |               +--> docker_adapter.py
    |               +--> podman_adapter.py
    |
    +--> specs/
    |       +--> firefox/
    |       +--> elastic/

    |       +--> stack_commands.py
    |
    +--> api/
    |       +--> node_routes.py
    |       +--> pod_routes.py
    |       +--> stack_routes.py
    |
    +--> frontend/
            +--> sg-compute-app.js
            +--> sg-compute-nodes.js
            +--> sg-compute-pods.js
            +--> sg-compute-specs.js
            +--> sg-compute-stacks.js
```

## Self-Hosting Capability

An interesting property: the Ephemeral Compute control plane should be able to run inside Ephemeral Compute. Give a node the right credentials (AWS API access) and it can start other nodes. This is recursion, but it is also practical: a CI pipeline running inside a node can spin up test nodes, run QA, and destroy them.

This works as long as the control plane is just a FastAPI service that calls AWS APIs. It does not need to be "special." It just needs credentials.

## The Growing Spec Library

The spec library is the product catalogue. Each spec is a recipe for a node type. The library is growing:

**Compute specs:** Docker, Podman (bare runtimes for custom workloads)
**Browser specs:** Firefox + MITM, Neko, Playwright (browser environments)
**Data specs:** Elastic + Kibana, OpenSearch (visualisation and analysis)
**Storage specs:** SG/Send Backend / Vault Server (encrypted vault storage)
**AI specs:** Ollama (local LLM inference)
**Dev specs:** Linux Terminal (bare shell access)

Each spec can be baked into an AMI. The AMI library mirrors the spec library. "Start a Firefox node from AMI" means: look up the Firefox spec, find the latest baked AMI, launch it.

This is the simulated AWS Marketplace: a catalogue of pre-configured, ready-to-launch environments.

## Relationship to Previous Briefs

| 1 | Product renamed from "SP" to "Ephemeral Compute" (or sg-compute) across code, CLI, API | No references to "SP" or "SGraph Playwright" remain |
| 2 | CLI uses `sg-compute node`, `sg-compute pod`, `sg-compute stack` | All commands follow new taxonomy |
| 3 | API endpoints use `/nodes`, `/pods`, `/stacks`, `/specs` | API schema matches new naming |
| 4 | Frontend navigation shows Nodes, Specs, Stacks, Settings | Left nav updated |
| 5 | Specs stored as JSON definitions per instance type | Each spec folder has a spec.json with AMI, config, defaults |
| 6 | "Stack" reserved for multi-node combinations only | No single-node entity called a stack anywhere |
| 7 | At least 6 specs defined (Docker, Podman, Firefox, Neko, Elastic, Playwright) | Spec definitions exist and are launchable |
| 8 | Folder structure matches taxonomy (core, specs, cli, api, frontend) | Code organisation reflects the naming |
| 9 | Old naming removed from all user-facing surfaces | No "SP," "stack" for single instances, or "instance" in the UI |
